===========

The "Instant Satisfaction by Obscure Unstable Protocol" (InstantSOUP) is an application-level protocol for local message exchange.
The protocol was developed during a telematics project at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) during the course of the winter semester 2011/2012.
InstantSOUP is responsible for connecting the user to a lobby in his or her local area network.
In this environment the user is able to interact with other participants and chat rooms.
